You have always told me it was Ernest.  I have introduced youto every one as Ernest.  You answer to the name of Ernest.  You look asif your name was Ernest.  You are the most earnest-looking person I eversaw in my life.  It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn'tErnest.  It's on your cards.  Here is one of them.  [Taking it fromcase.]  'Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.'  I'll keep this as aproof that your name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me, orto Gwendolen, or to any one else.  [Puts the card in his pocket.]
